A robust, powerful, and very simple ORM android database library with **annotation processing**.

The library is built on speed, performance, and approachability. It not only eliminates most boiler-plate code for dealing with databases, but also provides a powerful and simple API to manage interactions.

Let DBFlow make SQL code _flow_ like a _steady_ stream so you can focus on writing amazing apps.

# Why Use DBFlow
DBFlow is built from a collection of the best features of many database libraries in the most efficient way possible. Also, it is built to not only make it _significantly_ easier to deal with databases on Android, but also to provide extensibility. Don't let an ORM or library get in your way, let the code you write in your applications be the best as possible.
- **Extensibility**: No restrictions on inheritance of your table classes. They can be plain POJOs, no subclass required, but as a convenience we recommend using `BaseModel`. You can extend non-`Model` classes in different packages and use them as your DB tables. Also you can subclass other tables to join the `@Column` together, and again they can be in different packages.
- **Speed**: Built with java's annotation processing code generation, there's almost zero runtime performance hit by using this library (only reflection is creation of the main, generated database module's constructor). This library saves hours of boilerplate code and maintenance by generating the code for you. With powerful model caching (multiple primary key `Model` too), you can surpass the speed of SQLite by reusing where possible. We have support for lazy-loading relationships on-demand such as `@ForeignKey` or `@OneToMany` that make queries happen super-fast.
- **SQLite Query Flow**: The queries in this library adhere as closely as possible to SQLite native queries. `select(name, screenSize).from(Android.class).where(name.is("Nexus 5x")).and(version.is(6.0)).querySingle()`
- **Open Source**: This library is fully open source and contributions are not only welcomed, but encouraged.
- **Robust**: We support `Trigger`, `ModelView`, `Index`, `Migration`, built-in ways to manage database access, and many more features. SQLCipher, RXJava, and more!
- **Multiple Databases, Multiple Modules**: we seamlessly support multiple database files, database modules using DBFlow in other dependencies, simultaneously.
- **Built On SQLite**: SQLite is the most widely used database engine in world and using it as your base, you are not tied to a limited set of platforms or libraries.

# Changelog

# Usage Docs
For more detailed usage, check out it out [here](/usage2/Intro.md)

# Including in your project

```groovy

allProjects {
  repositories {
    // required to find the project's artifacts
    maven { url "https://www.jitpack.io" }
  }
}
```

Add the library to the project-level build.gradle, using the apt plugin to enable Annotation Processing:

```groovy

  def dbflow_version = "4.0.0-beta7"
  // or dbflow_version = "develop-SNAPSHOT" for grabbing latest dependency in your project on the develop branch
  // or 10-digit short-hash of a specific commit. (Useful for bugs fixed in develop, but not in a release yet)

  dependencies {
    annotationProcessor "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-processor:${dbflow_version}"

    // use kapt for kotlin apt if you're a Kotlin user
    kapt "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-processor:${dbflow_version}"

    compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-core:${dbflow_version}"
    compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow:${dbflow_version}"

    // sql-cipher database encryption (optional)
    compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-sqlcipher:${dbflow_version}"
    compile "net.zetetic:android-database-sqlcipher:${sqlcipher_version}@aar"

    // kotlin extensions
    compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-kotlinextensions:${dbflow_version}"

    // RXJava 1 support
    compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-rx:${dbflow_version}"

    // RXJava 1 Kotlin Extensions Support
    compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-rx-kotlinextensions:${dbflow_version}"

    // RXJava 2 support
    compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-rx2:${dbflow_version}"

    // RXJava 2 Kotlin Extensions Support
    compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-rx2-kotlinextensions:${dbflow_version}"

  }

// if you're building with Kotlin
  kapt {
    generateStubs = true
  }
```

# Pull Requests
I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:
  1. Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using CMD+Option+L (Reformat code) on Mac (not sure for Windows) with Android Studio defaults.
  2. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
  3. Please keep PR titles easy to read and descriptive of changes, this will make them easier to merge :)
  4. Pull requests _must_ be made against `develop` branch. Any other branch (unless specified by the maintainers) will get rejected.
  5. Have fun!
