A robust, powerful, and very simple ORM android database library with **annotation processing**.

The library is built on speed, performance, and approachability. It not only eliminates most boiler-plate code for dealing with databases, but also provides a powerful and simple API to manage interactions.

Let DBFlow make SQL code _flow_ like a _steady_ stream so you can focus on writing
amazing apps.

What sets this library apart:
  1. Many, many unit tests on nearly __every__ feature.
  2. Built on maximum performance using **annotation processing**, lazy-loading, and speed-tests [here](https://github.com/Raizlabs/AndroidDatabaseLibraryComparison)
  3. Built-in model caching for blazing-fast retrieval and very flexible customization.
  3. Powerful and fluid SQL-wrapping statements that mimic real SQLite queries
  4. Triggers, Views, Indexes, and many more SQLite features.
  5. Seamless multi-database support.
  6. Direct-to-database parsing for data such as JSON
  7. Flexibility in the API enabling you to override functionality to suit your needs.
  8. ```ContentProvider``` generation using annotations
  9. Content Observing using `Uri`

## Changelog

#### 2.2.1
1. Fixed issue with `OrderBy` where the `COLLATE` keyword was not appended to the query.
2. Fixed conversion and inconsistency issues within a `ModelContainer` adapter that have foreign keys and private fields.
3. Private primary keys now work with getter and setters, private fields within `ModelContainer` adapters now generate compilable code.

#### 2.2.0

1. Fixed a bug where `new Select().from(myTable.class).byId(PrimaryKey)` was incorrectly double-quoting columns.
2. Adds a primary key into the URI of a `FlowContentObserver` for single primary key tables.
3. Lazy loads `ModelAdapter` and `ModelViewAdapter` so subclassing a non-table `BaseModel` now
works without crashing/complaining. Just don't call the non-tables associated `Model` methods directly.
4. Bug fixes and Improvements
5. Adds the `OrderBy` object to aid in `ORDER BY` queries. Added `orderBy()` methods in the `From` class
for easier access without needing to call `where()` first. Adds `Collate` support within this class.
6. Adds a `enableSelfRefreshes()` for the `FlowQueryList` and souped up the documentation
with a "best practices" section.
7. Fixes bugs with the [Getting Started](https://github.com/Raizlabs/DBFlow/blob/master/usage/GettingStarted.md) section implementation. `OneToMany.Method.SAVE` now actually works on `insert`, `update`, and `save` methods.
8. Adds a `OnProgressProcessChangeListener` to listen for the total progress while
looping through saving models in a `ProcessModelTransaction`.
9. Escalated `convertToCacheableList()` to `public` and now can query to know if
a `Model` has a valid caching id. Also some more public methods added to `SqlUtils`!

## Including in your project

We need to include the [apt plugin](https://bitbucket.org/hvisser/android-apt) in our classpath to enable Annotation Processing:

```groovy

buildscript {
    repositories {
      // required for this library, don't use mavenCentral()
        jcenter()
    }
    dependencies {
        classpath 'com.neenbedankt.gradle.plugins:android-apt:1.8'
    }
}

```

Add the library to the project-level build.gradle, using the  to enable Annotation Processing:

```groovy

  apply plugin: 'com.neenbedankt.android-apt'

  dependencies {
    apt 'com.raizlabs.android:DBFlow-Compiler:2.2.1'
    compile "com.raizlabs.android:DBFlow-Core:2.2.1"
    compile "com.raizlabs.android:DBFlow:2.2.1"
  }

```

We only use reflection pretty much one time throughout the whole library, so this class is the only one needed.

### Gotchas/Compatibility

For `GSON` and `RetroFit` compatibility check out [#121](https://github.com/Raizlabs/DBFlow/issues/121).

Due to this library using a custom maven repo, to speed up build times when using this library,
you should run in `--offline` mode except for when updating dependencies. To enable
this setting in Android Studio, ensure the option is checked in:
`Preferences->Build,Executor,Deployment->Build Tools->Gradle->Offline Work`

## Pull Requests

I welcome and encourage all pull requests. It usually will take me within 24-48 hours to respond to any issue or request. Here are some basic rules to follow to ensure timely addition of your request:
  1. Match coding style (braces, spacing, etc.) This is best achieved using CMD+Option+L (Reformat code) on Mac (not sure for Windows) with Android Studio defaults.
  2. If its a feature, bugfix, or anything please only change code to what you specify.
   **DO NOT** do this: Ex: Title "Fixes Crash Related to Bug" includes other files that were changed without explanation or doesn't relate to the bug you fixed. Or another example is a non-descriptive title "Fixes Stuff".
  3. Pull requests must be made against ```develop``` branch.
  4. Have fun!
