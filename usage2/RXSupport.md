# RXJava Support

RXJava support in DBFlow is an _incubating_ feature and likely to change over time. We support both RX1 and RX2 and have made the extensions + DBFlow compatibility almost identical - save for the changes and where it makes sense in each version.

Currently it supports
  1. `Insert`, `Update`, `Delete`, `Set`, `Join`, and all wrapper query mechanisms by wrapping them in `rx()`
  2. Single + `List` model `save()`, `insert()`, `update()`, and `delete()`.
  3. Streaming a set of results from a query
  4. Observing on table changes for specific `ModelQueriable` and providing ability to query from that set repeatedly as needed.
  5. Kotlin extension methods in a separate artifact that enhance the conversion.

## Getting Started

Add the separate packages to your project:
```groovy

dependencies {
  // RXJava1
  compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-rx:${dbflow_version}"

  // optional, for use with Kotlin as a nice companion.
  compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-rx-kotlinextensions:${dbflow_version}"

  // RXJava2
  compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-rx2:${dbflow_version}"

  // optional, for use with Kotlin as a nice companion.
  compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-rx2-kotlinextensions:${dbflow_version}"
}

```

## Wrapper Language
Using the classes is as easy as wrapping all SQL wrapper calls with `RXSQLite.rx()` (Kotlin we supply extension method):

Before:
```java

List<MyTable> list = SQLite.select()
  .from(MyTable.class)
  .queryList();

```

After:

```java

RXSQLite.rx(
  SQLite.select().from(MyTable.class))
  .queryList()
  .subscribe((list) -> {

  });

```

or with Kotlin + extension methods:
```kotlin

  select.from(MyTable::class.java)
  .rx()
  .list { list ->

  }

```

## Model operations
To make the transition as smoothest as possible, we've provided a `BaseRXModel` which replaces `BaseModel` for convenience in the RX space.

```kotlin

class Person(@PrimaryKey var id: Int = 0, @Column var name: String? = "") : BaseRXModel

```

Operations are as easy as:
```java

new Person(5, "Andrew Grosner")
  .insert()
  .subscribe((rowId) -> {

  });

```

or with Kotlin+extensions:
```kotlin

Person(5, "Andrew Grosner")
  .insert { rowId ->

  }

```

## Query Stream

We can use RX to stream the result set, one at a time from the `ModelQueriable` using
the method `queryStreamResults()`:

```java

RXSQLite.rx(
    SQLite.select()
    .from(TestModel1.class))
   .queryStreamResults()
   .subscribe((model) -> {

   });

```

## Kotlin Support

Most of the support mirrors [kotlin support](/usage2/KotlinSupport.md) with a few
minor changes.

Extension properties/methods include:
  1. `rx()` extension method making it super easy to integrate RX.
  2. `RXModelQueriable.streamResults`  - stream results one at time to a `Subscription`
  3.  `list`, `result`,`streamResults`, `cursorResult`,`statement`, `hasData`, `cursor`, and `count` all provide a method lambda that is called within a `Subscription`.

```kotlin

select from MyTable::class
  where (MyTable.name `is` "Good")
  list { list -> //

  }

```

which is the same with RX as:

```kotlin

(select.from(MyTable::class.java)
  .where(MyTable.name `is` "Good"))
  .rx()
  .list { list ->

  }

```


Or if we want to get pretty with `BaseRXModel` + extensions:

```kotlin

Person("Somebody").save { success ->
  // do something
}

Person("Somebody").update { success ->
  // do something
}

Person("Somebody").insert { rowId ->
  // do something
}

Person("Somebody").delete { success ->
  // do something
}

```
