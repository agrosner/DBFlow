# Kotlin Support + Extensions

DBFlow supports Kotlin out of the box and is fairly easily to use and implement.


## Classes

DBFlow Classes are beautifully concise to write:

```kotlin
@Table(database = KotlinDatabase::class)
class Person() : BaseModel() {
    @PrimaryKey var id: Int = 0

    @Column var name: String? = null
}
```

Also `data` classes are supported, but they (for now) _must_ define `Model` implementation:

```kotlin
@Table(database = KotlinTestDatabase::class)
data class Car(@PrimaryKey var id: Int = 0, @Column var name: String? = null) : Model {

    override fun save() = modelAdapter<Car>().save(this)

    override fun delete() = modelAdapter<Car>().delete(this)

    override fun update() = modelAdapter<Car>().update(this)

    override fun insert() = modelAdapter<Car>().insert(this)

    override fun exists() = modelAdapter<Car>().exists(this)
}
```

Once we can use `default` methods on an interface in `Kotlin` `data` classes, this boilerplate will go away.

## Extensions

DBFlow as of `3.0.0+` contains some extensions for use in Kotlin. These
are defined in a separate dependency:

```
dependencies {
  compile "com.github.Raizlabs.DBFlow:dbflow-kotlinextensions:${dbflow_version}"
}

```

### Query Extensions

Note that these features are incubating and may change or get removed in a later version.


#### Query LINQ Syntax

Kotlin has nice support for custim `infix` operators. Using this we can convert a regular, Plain old java query into a C#-like LINQ syntax.

java:
```

List<Result> = SQLite.select()
                .from(Result.class)
                .where(Result_Table.column.eq(6))
                .and(Result_Table.column2.in("5", "6", "9")).queryList()

```

kotlin:

```
val results = (select
              from Result::class
              where (column eq 6)
              and (column2 `in`("5", "6", "9"))
              groupBy column).list
              // can call .result for single result
              // .hasData if it has results
              // .statement for a compiled statement
```

Enabling us to write code that is closer in syntax to SQLite!

This supported for almost any SQLite operator that this library provides including:
  1. `Select`
  2. `Insert`
  3. `Update`
  4. `Delete`

**Async Operations**:
With extensions we also support `async` operations on queries:

```kotlin

// easy async list query
(select
    from Result::class
    where (column eq 6))
.async list { transaction, list ->
    // do something here
    updateUI(list)
}

// easy single result query
(select
    from Result::class
    where (column eq 6))
.async result { transaction, model ->
    // do something here
    updateUI(model)
}

val model = Result()

model.async save {
  // completed, now do something with model
}

```

### Property Extensions

With Kotlin, we can define extension methods on pretty much any class.

With this, we added methods to easily create `IProperty` from anything to make
queries a little more streamlined. In this query, we also make use of the extension
method for `from` to streamline the query even more.

```kotlin

var query = (select
  from TestModel::class
  where (5.property lessThan column)
  and (clause(date.property between start_date)
        and(end_date)))


```

### Database Extensions

The more interesting part is the extensions here.

#### Process Models Asynchronously

In Java, we need to write something of the fashion:

```java

List<TestModel> items = SQLite.select()
    .from(TestModel.class)
    .queryList();

TransactionManager.getInstance()
  .add(new ProcessModelTransaction(ProcessModelInfo.withModels(items), null) {
    @Override
    public void processModel(TestModel model) {
        // do something.
    }
});

```

In Kotlin, we can use a combo of DSL and extension methods to:

```kotlin

var items = (select from TestModel1::class).list

 // easily delete all these items.
 items.processInTransactionAsync { it, databaseWrapper -> it.delete(databaseWrapper) }

 // easily delete all these items with success
 items.processInTransactionAsync({ it, databaseWrapper -> it.delete(databaseWrapper) },
            Transaction.Success {
                // do something here
            })
// delete with all callbacks
items.processInTransactionAsync({ it, databaseWrapper -> it.delete(databaseWrapper) },
    Transaction.Success {
        // do something here
    },
    Transaction.Error { transaction, throwable ->

    })

```

The extension method on `Collection<T>` allows you to perform this on all
collections from your Table!

If you wish to easily do them _synchronously_ then use:

```kotlin

items.processInTransaction { it, databaseWrapper -> it.delete(databaseWrapper) }

```

#### Class Extensions

If you need access to the Database, ModelAdapter, etc for a specific class you
can now:


```kotlin

database<TestModel>

tableName<TestModel>

modelAdapter<TestModel>

```


Which under-the-hood call their corresponding `FlowManager` methods.
